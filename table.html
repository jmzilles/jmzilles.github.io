      <h2>Expanding Coffee Table</h2>
      <p>This was a project for a mechanical engineering product design class at Berkeley. My 
        team elected to design and prototype a coffee table that could expand into a full-sized 
        dining table. Over the course of a semester, we designed, analyzed, iterated, prototyped, 
        built, and presented our table.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Our goal was to create a functional prototype for a table with the capacity to become 
      both a coffee table and a full-sized dining table, primarily targeting college students and 
      city-dwelling consumers living in small apartments. We emphasized ease of transport, ease 
      of use, style, and affordability. We performed market research, learning that the average 
      American under 40 will move 8 times in their life, the average living space per capita in 
      cities is 292 sq ft, and the global small space furniture market is expected to grow 6% year 
      over year. We observed our competitors in the space, noting that existing products were either 
      impractical, flimsy and cheap, or too expensive for our target customers. Because of this 
      research, we decided to focus on the following features in this order: usability (ease of 
      use, ability to expand/contract), cost for consumer, style (desirable visual appearance), 
      ease of assembly, and transportability. Our team made a business model canvas to determine 
      key partners, activities, and resources, as well as customer relationships and advertisement 
      channels.</p>
  <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>As a team, we conducted market research by interviewing college students and decided on the 
        following specifications to design off of: the weight had to be 50lbs or less, the optimal 
        dimensions of the coffee table were 15x36x24in, with the full expanded height being 28-30in, 
        the cost to consumer had to be $100-200, the minimum load capability should be 250lbs, and the 
        transition time between coffee and dining table needed to be under 5 minutes. We brainstormed 
        over 50 potential designs then used a concept selection matrix to narrow it down to two. We 
        then combined the best aspects of these designs and had a starting point. I completed several 
        iterations of CAD using Solidworks, creating a table that utilized sliding rails to raise the 
        legs of the table, increasing the height. The coffee table legs were three pieces, with two 
        sliding across each other to expand vertically and one rotating out to extend the length of 
        the table. The legs were held in the extended position by pins and the arms were supported by 
        internal beams, which could easily be positioned from the outside in one smooth motion. For 
        aesthetic purposes, rounded pieces were added in the corners, hiding the necessary cutout. 
        After designing, we used Solidworks simulations to conduct FEA, testing how much weight the 
        table would be able to hold in both configurations. After successful results, we moved to 
        prototyping.</p>
    <h2>Prototyping</h2>
        <p>To prototype this table, I first 3D printed all of the parts at 1/4 scale. This method of 
          rapid prototyping both minimized the time needed to finish a prototype and cut down on the 
          cost. I used FDM printing for the large components and SLA for the more precise pieces. I also 
          had to calculate the different tolerances required for the 3D printed parts. After printing 
          and assembling the table, all functions were working as designed, so the second prototype was 
          started. This was a full-size plywood prototype, with aluminum extrusion beams and aluminum 
          pins. Plywood was chosen due to its low cost, as this prototype was self-funded. MDF would have 
          been the preferred choice. Plywood was cut using a CNC mill, and two layers of 0.75‚Äù plywood 
          were layered together after milling to create the internal components. This prototype had many 
          flaws, but it was functional and a good demonstration of the concept and the design. We 
          presented this prototype and received a high grade on the project.</p>
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>This project was a great experience for product design and CNC milling. The project took me 
            through the background of coming up with a product and all of the analysis that happens 
            before anything is designed, such as market research. There was also a large amount of 
            problem solving that this project allowed me to perform. During manufacturing of the 
            prototype we had a finite amount of plywood to work with and when pieces were improperly 
            cut or not lining up correctly, I had to come up with solutions quickly. A few small redesigns
            were required to aid the final prototype in coming together, but in the end, we were 
            successful in finishing the prototype on time. There is obvious room for improvement in this 
            product, but the project overall was a success.</p>
