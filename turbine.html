      <h2>Scale Wind Turbine</h2>
      <p>This was the final project for 3-Dimensional Modeling and Design course at 
        UC Berkeley. The project goal was to create a wind turbine blade and base. 
        The blade was tested in a mock wind tunnel with the goal of generating the 
        most electricity compared to the rest of the teams, while the base was tested 
        with weights and a fully with the goal of withstanding the most force. In this 
        project I was the manufacturing lead and I also collaborated with another 
        team member on creating the generative design for the base.

      <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>This project explored the capabilities of wind turbine design. Our group was tasked with 
      3D printing a wind turbine that could hold a 1 kg load and generate the maximum power 
      possible within an 18 in3 volume and 16 in height constraint. Our group met frequently to 
      brainstorm and research the expansive field of wind turbine design, and combine our researched 
      knowledge with our Solidworks proficiency to create a product that maximized efficiency and 
      stability. As a result, our group produced an organic model that strayed from industry standard 
      but still successfully met the requirements of this challenge.<br><br> To start the design process 
      our group researched the key aspects of the most efficient wind turbine designs and debated the 
      pros and cons of each. We also expanded our turbine design vocabulary by researching the most 
      efficient pitch, angle of rotation, aerofoil, and angle of attack of our turbine blade. After 
      careful evaluation, we used experimental research to determine the best turbine blade, designed 
      in Solidworks. <br><br>Following the blade design was the tower structure. We found through research 
      that multiple types of turbines are currently used (i.e. cross hatching towers and conical towers), 
      however these are most efficient when scaled to real life size. Given the small volume constraint 
      of the project, we decided a computer generated tower design would prove most efficient for our 
      goals. <br><br>Using Solidworks, we produced a unique, organic model created from countless stiffness 
      and efficiency tests done by a computer, which took the guessing work out of tower design. Its 
      unique structure was designed specifically for the requirements of the project, and made use of 
      the allotted height and volume. The program also created the design file. <br><br>With a blade and 
      tower created, our team glued the tower together and later commenced a stiffness and power test. 
      Our tower weighed in at 1325.3g, was 16 in tall, and had a maximum power of 1.21 watts. The tower 
      successfully sustained the load of 1 kg with a deflection of .37mm. Our group added additional 
      weight to a maximum of 9 kg with a deflection of 3.81mm—however the tower did not break under 
      this much weight and we were not able to go to failure with the deflection test. Our turbine 
      design went above and beyond and met the objectives of the project.</p>
  <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>The course of our design for the wind turbine was broken into two parts: the blades and 
        the tower. This decision was made because so long as the tower met the 16 in height 
        requirement and was stable enough to hold the blades and motor it would not in any 
        significant way interfere with the performance of the turbine blades. For the design 
        of the turbine blades, we began by finding an adequate airfoil profile. Through our 
        research, we decided on using the SG6043 airfoil profile as it was designed to perform 
        well in low Reynolds number scenarios which our small scale mandated. From there, we 
        decided to use three blades as that was the most efficient design and was commonly used. 
        With the profile and number of blades decided we then had to decide on the angle of attack 
        and blade profile twist. We decided on an 8-degree angle of attack because the SG6043 
        airfoil at low Reynolds Numbers achieves its peak lift to drag ratio at 8 degrees which 
        we also confirmed via fluid simulation in Solidworks. As for the blade profile twist, our 
        research as well as Solidworks fluid simulation indicated that a 15-degree twist from 8 
        degrees to -7 degrees would be ideal. The final design decision we had to make was that 
        of chord length for our blades. Given that chord length directly correlated to lift 
        generated, we maximized our chord lengths while staying within the width constraints of 
        the pre-designed blade hub. Given all those design decisions, we arrived at our final 
        blade hub pictured below. The final blade and hub design was 3 in. in diameter and 0.25 in. 
        tall. <br><br>For the design of the tower, the process was more straightforward. Tasked with 
        maximizing our stiffness to mass ratio, we employed topology optimization to maximize the 
        strength of our tower. Starting from a generic rectangular prism matching the tower build 
        dimensions (sans the motor hub which we designed separately and simply to fit dimensionally 
        with the motor) we used the Topology Study feature in Solidworks and the loading scenario 
        given in the testing procedure to create a model that fit within the 18 in3 limitations. 
        The hub which was designed separately and added to the top of the tower.</p>
    <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
        <p>The most significant tool used in the fabrication of the turbine was a 3d printer which 
          additively created our designs. About 235 grams of ABS plastic was used in this step which 
          printed the design in three parts: the blades and hub, the bottom half of the tower, and 
          the top half of the tower. The amount of ABS plastic used costs about 10 USD. After the 
          designs were printed and the supports removed, the top and bottom half of the tower were 
          glued together using a small volume of the ethyl-based adhesive Loctite Super Glue. Finally 
          the entire tower was glued to the base plate using the same glue.</p>
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>The efficiency of our turbine was significantly lower than the efficiency of the 
            average commercial turbine. The efficiency of an average turbine is 20-40% while 
            ours was 7.13% (“Renewable Energy Fact Sheet: Wind Turbines”, 2013). This could 
            be due to the differing scales between our design and real turbines.<br>
            Overall, we all learned a lot about wind turbines and their construction. The 
            project also allowed us to learn more about Solidworks, basic fluid dynamics, and 
            the math behind what makes an effective wind turbine. Even though it wasn't as efficient 
            as we would have liked, the tower performed a lot better than we expected to in the 
            deflection test and we are satisfied with our results.</p>
