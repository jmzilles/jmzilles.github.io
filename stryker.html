      <h1>Stryker</h1>
      <p>In the summer of 2023, I completed an internship with Stryker Sports Medicine in 
        San Jose, CA as an R&D intern. I had the opportunity to work on the designing, 
        prototyping, and testing processes of multiple surgical devices in all stages of 
        development. I was lucky to be able to collaborate with many different teams and 
        engineers and complete meaningful work toward the development and release of products 
        for Stryker. I worked at a high level both hands-on and digitally, using machine 
        shop tools and polymer 3D printing, operating in mock surgical conditions, utilizing 
        Solidworks and Solidworks PDM to create complex CAD files and assemblies, and working 
        with both legacy and new designs.

    <h2>Projects Summary</h2>
    <p>Over three months, I worked primarily on four projects, two of which were 
      centered on new product design. The first was a snap-on fixture that could be optionally 
      added to a production surgical device, with the need for this product coming from surgeon 
      feedback and competitor products in the market. The second new product design project was a 
      ground-up project of a new surgical tool. I worked as the lead designer for this product, 
      working with the marketing department as I designed and prototyped. The other two projects 
      I worked on were product development testing. One of these products was in the late stages 
      of development, getting ready for release, and the other was a product in the early stages, 
      starting testing.</p>
  <h2>Product Design</h2>

      <p><i>Snap-on Fixture</i></p>
      <p>As a medical devices company, Stryker is always innovating and iterating 
        their surgical tools based on new research, new surgeon needs, and new technologies, all 
        focused on creating easier, more successful surgeries. While this often means creating new 
        products to replace old offerings, occasionally changes can be made to products through 
        external additions. I was tasked with designing, prototyping, and testing a snap-on fixture 
        for a line of products that would increase their usage capabilities. Using primarily Solidworks 
        and GD&T, I designed a variety of snap-on fixtures that would have the physical properties 
        necessary to achieve the desired results. Through iteration and prototyping using an inkjet 
        3D printer, I made and tested multiple different options with a wide range of shapes. Through 
        this iteration process, I was able to pinpoint the most effective design for the desired results, 
        and through testing confirmed adequate, repeatable data. As a result, the snap-on fixture that 
        I designed began usage for the testing process that the product is undergoing. This fixture will 
        allow the product to have expanded use cases and increased safety.

      <p><i>New Surgical Device</i></p>
      <p>As previously stated, Stryker is constantly developing new products to improve performance and 
        fill gaps in existing product lines. Stryker was looking to expand one of these product lines 
        based on a specific type of surgery, in which the current products were working, but could be 
        better. I took on the design project as the lead and began by researching the existing products 
        and the desired surgery to understand where the shortcomings were and what could be improved. 
        I also received marketing’s desires for the product’s design and features. Using this information, 
        I used Solidworks to create a multi-piece assembly of the new product. This assembly had to have 
        a cover piece that could slide in and out of place easily but never fall off. I also had to 
        design within the existing silhouette of a product so that the new product would feel familiar 
        to surgeons and would fit in existing packaging. The largest constraint was the force requirement, 
        as the device had to be capable of withstanding multiple sharp blows. After finishing the CAD, I 
        used an inkjet 3D printer to prototype the product, then completed other assembly through the 
        dismantling of similar products and pieced together a working prototype. With this prototype, I 
        performed testing in a mock surgical environment and from my results, I returned to my CAD to 
        iterate and improve. After a few cycles of prototyping, testing, and iterating, the product was 
        delivered to marketing. As a surgical device, there will be many levels of testing and design 
        modifications before this product reaches the market. However, the first steps are complete and due 
        to the need for this product, it will likely hit the market in the upcoming years.</p>
  <h2>Product Development Testing</h2>

      <p><i>Near Market</i></p>
      <p>An updated product of one of Stryker’s more important lines is nearing release, and some final 
        testing still needed to be done. Over the course of my internship, I spent hours assembling these 
        devices for testing and also ran tests. While assembly can often be seen as simply manual labor, 
        it was a good learning experience about designing for assembly. These devices had to be assembled 
        in a factory before being shipped out to surgeons, so the better they were designed, the faster 
        and easier they could be assembled, minimizing errors. Through assembling these products, I 
        learned about tools for assembly that Stryker uses and also design additions that can help 
        assembly. The tests I ran were primarily UTS tests using hand-held force gauges and an Instron. 
        In a multi-piece device such as this one, it was interesting to learn about options for testing 
        and how to test specific pieces to failure. The data I collected from my testing was constantly 
        recorded and compiled with all test data from the product and affected design changes and product 
        specifications.

      <p><i>Early Development</i></p>
      <p>I led the first rounds of material testing for a new product in early development. After 
        receiving samples of the product in two different materials, I used the spec. sheet to check 
        whether the product was within the dimensions ordered. I then tested the two materials in a mock 
        surgical environment, specifically watching material wear over a number of cycles. At constant 
        intervals, I used a Keyence imaging system to view the product at high magnification and measure 
        the changes in dimensions due to wear. Overall, I completed this testing for three separate 
        materials with products from two separate production lines and under two different sets of 
        conditions, coming out to a total of five rounds of testing. I recorded all of my data both 
        manually and digitally and wrote a testing report at the end of every set of tests, sharing the 
        report with all engineers involved in the product. Based on my testing, a material was chosen for 
        its superior performance, and the two sets of conditions were proven to both be safe for the usage 
        of the product.
      </p>
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>My time at Stryker helped greatly to develop my design and engineering skills. I’m very 
            grateful to my team for their help throughout my internship and the friendships I made. My 
            favorite project was designing a new surgical device from the ground up and I enjoyed every 
            failure and learning experience along the way.</p>
