      <h2>Product Design - BEAR Adventure Vehicles</h2>
      <p>This was a project I worked on with a small truck-bed camper 
        startup in Ojai, CA. They needed a CAD design of their base model 
        camper to be able to share with potential customers. This would 
        allow customers to see what they were getting and make modifications 
        before the build process. The project was done in Fusion360 based 
        on measurements taken from 2D sketches on-site.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>BEAR Adventure Vehicles is a custom truck-bed camper startup that 
        designs and builds ultra-light weight camper shell builds for a 
        variety of truck types. The majority of their campers are built 
        to order, and materials and designs are carefully selected for 
        durability and weight reduction. All campers are designed to put up 
        with heavy, active use, including off-roading.</p>
    <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>This base camper model is split into the left, right, and front sides. 
          Upon entry, the left side has multiple cabinets intended for food, cleaning, 
          and sanitary supplies. There is an integrated sink and space for water 
          storage. Further along on the left, there is a vertical closet and a built-in 
          fridge. In the front, there is a full queen sized mattress and seating area 
          with storage beneath, including water cans. Behind the seating and under the 
          base of the mattress, there is space for the integrated electronics and camper 
          supplies. Working to the right, the bench seating continues, along with a 
          small angled step. There is more tall storage space, where a portable shower 
          could be installed. Beneath this space, there are more cabinets. The base of 
          all of the cabinets are inset to allow feet to fit underneath while standing 
          against the sides of the camper.</p>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
          <p>Upon completion of this project, it was sent out to customers to show them 
            what their camper would look like. I was able to export the designs as a 
            .usdz file, which can be opened on an iPhone to display the design, at real 
            size, in augmented reality. This was a very unique feature that allowed 
            customers to be able to walk through their future camper before it had ever 
            been built.</p>
