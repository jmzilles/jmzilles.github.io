      <h2>Medical Device - Arch Day Design</h2>
      <p>This is a project I worked on with engineering consulting company 
        in Ventura, CA. The company does mostly medical device design for 
        industry clients. This was my first experience with this type of 
        engineering, and since then I have been very interested in working 
        on designing to improve human lives.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Arch Day Design hired me to work as a manufacturing and quality engineer 
      for their regulated medical device project. The product was a cup for people 
      with disabilities that impacted swallowing liquids. The cup would dispense 
      a set amount of liquid, usually 5 or 10cc. This was a redesign for a company 
      that has a similar product, but wanted an updated model that would allow users 
      to be less self-conscious about needing the device by disguising the internal 
      workings. By hiring me, Arch Day was able to save their client thousands of 
      dollars, as I was capable of providing the necessary 3D printed models at a 
      fraction of the price that Arch Day could.</p>
  <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>While I was not in a lead design role for this project, I suggested changes 
        for ease of manufacturing, which, at the time, was FDM 3D printing. I worked 
        with the owner of Arch Day on positioning of the handle, as well as debossing 
        the text on the lid, and others.</p>
    <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
        <p>As the head of manufacturing during the prototyping phase, I was in charge 
          of 3D printing all of our models and helping ship them across the US to the 
          rest of the team. I worked with my two personal FDM 3D printers to quickly 
          turn around the models, running my printers constantly. With every variation, 
          I optimized the slicing process to improve print speed, quality, and 
          impermeability. Each model was printed in two parts, the lid and the cup, 
          with each of these prints requiring custom supports to be feasibly printed. 
          <br><br>This project, and working for Arch Day, was the single most educational 
          engineering experience I had up to that point. It greatly furthered my 
          understanding of design and manufacturing, and improved my CAD, slicing, and 
          3D printing skills. Most importantly, I felt good knowing that my work was a 
          direct factor in helping people.</p>
